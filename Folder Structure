The Linux folder structure follows the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS), which defines the directory layout and contents in Linux-based systems. Here’s an overview of the key folders and their purposes:

📁 / – Root Directory
The top-level directory; everything starts from here.
All other files and directories are subdirectories of /.

📁 /bin – Essential User Binaries
Contains basic Linux commands used by all users (e.g., ls, cp, mv, bash).

Needed for booting and repairing the system.

📁 /sbin – System Binaries
Contains essential system commands (e.g., fsck, reboot, iptables) used mostly by the system administrator.

📁 /etc – Configuration Files
Contains system-wide configuration files (e.g., /etc/hostname, /etc/fstab, /etc/ssh/ssh_config).
No binaries here.

📁 /dev – Device Files
Represents hardware devices as files (e.g., /dev/sda, /dev/null).
Interacts with system hardware.

📁 /proc – Process Information
Virtual filesystem containing runtime system information (e.g., /proc/cpuinfo, /proc/1/status).
Used to access process and kernel info.

📁 /sys – System Information
Interface to the kernel and hardware devices.
Works closely with /proc.

📁 /var – Variable Files
Stores variable data like logs (/var/log), mail, and spools.
Grows over time (log files, caches, etc.).

📁 /tmp – Temporary Files
Temporary files created by applications.
Typically cleared on reboot.

📁 /usr – User Programs and Data
Contains user applications and files.
/usr/bin – Non-essential user commands.
/usr/sbin – Non-essential system commands.
/usr/lib – Libraries for /usr/bin and /usr/sbin.
/usr/share – Architecture-independent data.

📁 /home – User Home Directories
Each user has a subdirectory here (e.g., /home/alice).
Contains personal files, configs, and documents.

📁 /root – Root User’s Home Directory
Home directory for the superuser (root), not to be confused with /.

📁 /lib – Essential Libraries
Shared libraries needed by binaries in /bin and /sbin.

📁 /opt – Optional Software Packages
Used for installing add-on application software packages.

📁 /mnt and 📁 /media – Mount Points
/mnt – Temporarily mounted filesystems.
/media – Auto-mounted removable media (e.g., USB drives, CDs).

📁 /boot – Boot Loader Files
Contains kernel and bootloader files (e.g., vmlinuz, initrd.img, grub).

📁 /run – Runtime Data
Stores transient system info, such as process IDs and sockets, valid until reboot.
